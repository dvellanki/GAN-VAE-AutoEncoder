# Neural Network experiments

## Neural Networks building blocks

- [Batch Normalization](batch_normalization/): Explaination of how Batch Normalization works, why it improves networks convergence and how to implement a Batch Normalization layer in Pytorch (see [notebook](batch_normalization/batch_normalization.ipynb)).

## Neural Networks architectures

- [Generative models](generative_models/): Presentation of different kind of generative models (GANs, VAEs, ..)

  - [Variational Auto Encoders](generative_models/variational_auto_encoders/): Explaination of how they work and how to implement them in Pytorch.
